My name's Maiia (IPA: [ˈmajə], Russian: Майя). I'm a data scientist and my work mostly focuses on NLP and speech. I speak five natural languages (in varying degrees of proficiency though :sweat_smile:) as well as have a grasp on a few programming languages. I started out as a linguist as I've been absolutely fascinated by the concept of language in general for years. After finishing my undegrad in Russia, I moved to Scotland to study speech and language processing and then joined an R&D group at a research institute back at home. In my spare time, I enjoy reading, playing piano, swimming, taking photos of everything around me, and ~not sleeping on weekends~ participating in hackathons.
