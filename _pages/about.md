<div style="text-align: justify;">My name's Maiia (IPA: [ˈmajjə], Russian: Майя). I'm a data scientist and my work mostly focuses on NLP and speech. I started out as a linguist as I've been absolutely fascinated by the concept of language in general for years. After finishing my undegrad in Russia, I moved to Scotland to study speech and language processing and then joined an R&D group at a research institute back at home. In my spare time, I enjoy reading, playing piano, swimming, taking photos of everything around me, and participating in hackathons and pub quizzes.</div>


<h2>Russian G2P</h2>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Here is a tool that can automatically translate Russian texts to International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). <b>NB:</b> this tool is a side project that I work on in my spare time. It's still under development and may lack some of the planned functionalities.</div>
