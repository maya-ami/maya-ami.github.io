<div style="text-align: justify;">The goal of speech synthesis, also known as text-to-speech, is to convert written texts into spoken speech. Speech synthesis finds application in many areas of our everyday life, ranging from announcements at train stations to voice assistants in call centers.</div>
<p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Given we have the recordings of a person speaking, we may recreate their voice to generate arbitrary utterances. This is a unique opportunity for people who have lost their voices due to some medical issues. Text-to-speech can also be used to reconstruct the voice of deceased loved ones. Sometimes hearing reassuring things in the voice of a late beloved may help to process the grief and ease the pain.</div>
<p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">...Or we can build our own voice right now just for fun!</div>
<p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Here are several samples of synthetically created utterances along with the reference, i.e. me pronouncing the same sentence. Speech samples under "Unit selection" header are generated by an open-source framework Festival using the custom voice I've built on my own speech data (around 400 recordings of me reading prompts from the ARCTIC dataset.). Samples under "SV2TTS" are created with the help of SV2TTS, a real-time voice cloning framework that uses pre-trained deep neural networks.</div>
<p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">All wave files have the following characteristics: 16kHz sampling rate, 1 channel, 16-bit.</div>
